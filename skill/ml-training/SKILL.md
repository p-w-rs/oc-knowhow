# Training and experiments

## Environment

- One Pixi workspace per project, committed with `pixi.lock`. NVIDIA and AMD in **separate environments**:
  - `cuda`: conda-forge `pytorch-gpu` + `cuda-version = "13.*"` on a platform that declares CUDA
    (`platforms = [{ platform = "linux-64", cuda = "13.0" }]`; `[system-requirements]` is the deprecated form).
  - `rocm`: PyTorch ROCm wheels via PyPI (`torch = { version = "…", index = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm<ver>" }`);
    conda-forge has no ROCm PyTorch. Check https://pytorch.org/get-started for the current index names.
- Verify on the machine before blaming code: `pixi run -e cuda python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__,
  torch.version.cuda, torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name())"` (ROCm: `torch.version.hip`; AMD GPUs
  still use the `torch.cuda` API). Driver vs toolkit: `nvidia-smi` / `rocm-smi`.
- Code stays device-agnostic: `device = "cuda"`, no `nvidia-smi` parsing in training code, no CUDA-only libraries
  without a fallback, and test the ROCm environment in CI or on an AMD box when AMD support matters.

## MLflow (default experiment tracker)

Use MLflow for every training, evaluation, export and benchmark run (MLflow 3.x; check `mlflow --version`).

- Add `mlflow` (conda-forge) to the project. Local server: `pixi run mlflow server` (UI and API at
  http://127.0.0.1:5000; default backend `sqlite:///mlflow.db`, artifacts in `./mlartifacts`; the old `./mlruns`
  file store is being deprecated). A shared server: set `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` (and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN` or
  username/password if it needs auth; never hard-code them). Remote access needs `--host 0.0.0.0 --allowed-hosts …`.
- Logging:
  ```python
  import mlflow
  mlflow.set_experiment("detector-v2")                 # or MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME
  with mlflow.start_run(run_name="r50-640px-fp16", log_system_metrics=True):   # GPU util/memory every 10 s
      mlflow.log_params({"lr": lr, "batch": bs, "precision": "bf16", "git_sha": sha, "data_rev": data_rev})
      for step, metrics in train():
          mlflow.log_metrics(metrics, step=step)
      mlflow.log_artifact("config.yaml")
      info = mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, name="model", step=step)   # MLflow 3: LoggedModel, load via info.model_uri
  ```
  System metrics need `psutil` and `nvidia-ml-py` (NVIDIA) or `pyrsmi` (AMD). `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` covers
  Lightning only; plain loops log manually. In MLflow 3 use `name=` (not `artifact_path=`) and `models:/<model_id>`
  URIs; `runs:/<run_id>/model` is deprecated.
- Tag every run with what makes it reproducible: git commit (and dirty flag), Pixi lock hash, dataset revision
  (e.g. Hugging Face dataset sha), seed, hardware (GPU, driver, CUDA/ROCm version).
- Compare instead of eyeballing logs: `mlflow.search_runs(experiment_names=["detector-v2"], filter_string="metrics.val_map
  > 0.5 and params.precision = 'bf16'", order_by=["metrics.val_map DESC"])` (a DataFrame), or `mlflow runs list` /
  `mlflow experiments search` on the CLI. Report the comparison table to the user.
- Deployment runs (ONNX/TensorRT/benchmarks, see ml-deploy) go in the same experiment or a linked one, with the parent
  training run id as a tag.

## Long runs on GPU machines

- Run on the remote machine (oc-machine SSH aliases, RunPod pods, Azure VMs) inside `tmux new -d -s train '…'` or
  `nohup … > train.log 2>&1 &`, not in a foreground shell that dies with the connection. Check with `tail -n 50
  train.log`, `nvidia-smi` / `rocm-smi`, and the MLflow UI. Copy results back with rsync.
- Checkpoint regularly (model, optimizer, scheduler, scaler, RNG state, step) and support resuming; log checkpoint
  paths. Stop paid machines when done (the RunPod/Azure plugins track running cost).

## Training performance

- Mixed precision: `torch.autocast(dtype=torch.bfloat16)` on Ampere+/MI200+ (no grad scaler), FP16 with `GradScaler`
  otherwise. TF32 for FP32 matmuls on NVIDIA: `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True`.
- `torch.compile(model)` (check graph breaks with `TORCH_LOGS=graph_breaks`), channels-last for convnets, fused
  optimizers (`fused=True`), `pin_memory=True` and enough `num_workers`, `non_blocking=True` copies.
- Find the bottleneck before optimizing: data loading vs GPU (GPU util in system metrics, the PyTorch profiler,
  `nsys`). Multi-GPU: `torchrun` + DDP first; FSDP2 when the model doesn't fit.
- Related skills: **ml-data** (formats, sharding, loaders that keep the GPU busy), **ml-tuning** (LR range test,
  1cycle, batch size, optimizers incl. Muon, normalization, regularization, EMA), **ml-qat** (quantization-aware
  training).

## Plan for deployment while training

If the model will run on an edge device (see ml-deploy): pick ops that TensorRT supports and fuses, keep shapes static
or bounded, avoid data-dependent control flow, use sizes that are multiples of 8/16, export to ONNX early and often
(a CI check), and consider QAT/sparsity-aware fine-tuning if INT8/FP8 PTQ loses accuracy (ml-qat skill). Evaluate the exported/
quantized model's accuracy, not only the PyTorch model's.
